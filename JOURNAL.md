This is my journal of the design and building process of **CNC Router**.

## 10/5/2025 - The beginning, and the end of all of my freetime  

 Well, crud.

I need to confess, I have absolutely no clue how to make a CNC router, but I like the idea of having one, so I guess we're doing this now.

## First, let's establish parameters:


I need this mill to:

+ Run consistently and without any weird calibration shenanigans This means using LinuxCNC with a bit of luck
+ Have onboard controllers, so I can run it remotely.
+ Be compatible with KVMs or remote access, for the same
+ It needs to look cool, and most importantly, not make a huge mess.

## The Beginning

I'd like to say that I spent a few hours researching the wide variety of CNC mills, their parts, and the various coping mechanisms for anyone who has had the misfortune of trying to build one, but I'd be a liar. Instead, I used AI to give me a quick summary of different options I can take, then I spent a few hours researching those, effectively reducing the time I saved into the negatives. 

What I eventually learned is that CNC routers are stupid, and instead of going on this confidence destroying journey I should instead go and buy one like a real man.

Fortunately I can barely read as is.

So I eventually decided I can save some money on the controller by using a Raspberry Pi 4 with a custom HAT to control the endpoints, and a power supply PCB I either manufacture myself out of my tears, or purchase at a high markup.

Since I'm going for precision, and cleanliness, I plan on using a *Moving Gantry* design, with mechanical switches for endstops and a touch plate to zero my tools. 

Now, all of this took me about 6 hours, and since I forgot to make the project until about 10 minutes ago, I need to actually lock in and work now. Here's a picture of my current mental state for your enjoyment.
